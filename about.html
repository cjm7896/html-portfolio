<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Christina. I was born and raised in southeast Michigan.</p>

<p>I received by Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with the focus in web development in 2014. I elected to complete this at an online college as my children were young and this did not allow much time to attend a brick and mortar college. I also continued working at the factory where I had been employe, while completing the program.</p>

<p>I have not landed a job using the degree earned. However, I have worked in an IT helpdesk role for three years. I have also completed the Google IT Support certification.</p>
